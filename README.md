# Automatic-Image-based-Invoice-Logger
This project is used to record essential invoice/receipt information, categorize spending, and make a record in Google Sheets by just uploading the invoice/receipt image.

In general this project works by converting image into a text, which text will be put as a question that would be answered by a generative AI that will be asked to take information from given text, take several informations and turn it into the desirable and more consistent format. Output received from the generative AI is then recorded in a Google Sheet file to track record of one's spending habits. The overall process is could be seen in the flowchart given below:
